	A collection of methods for working with immutable data in a functional way for Roblox Lua.

Cryo is a library that helps you write more terse code that deals with immutable data. It includes traditional FP list primitives like `map`, `filter`, and `foldLeft`, as well as tools inspired by JavaScript like joining dictionaries.

Cryo works well to make [Rodux](https://github.com/Roblox/rodux) reducers cleaner!
